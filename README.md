# zmk-config
This project was such a pain in the butt, but it was so worth it. Soldering every single piece of the keyboard together meant so much room for mistake.
There was probably two dozen times when I said "No way this works", yet every time someone on the ZMK or Keebio discord was willing to
help me. This contains my choosen keymap with some basic configurations. I can't for the life of me figure out how to do layers but hopefully the dev at
my work will understand whatever lanauage this is in and the ZMK documentation more than I do. I melted some of the keycaps with the soldering iron,
but that's why I didn't buy $200 GMK keycaps for this and these are just Keychron WoB. I hope this forces me to learn to touch type because oh my godness
I can't type properly
